Data Science Template
=====================

A simple [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template for creating a modern (python) data science project.

## Features
- [Poetry]() for dependency management
- [nbdime]() to easily version jupyter notebooks using git
- Commonly used packages like pandas, matplotlib, numpy and many more already included
- [pre-commit]() hooks such as [isort]() and [black]() for consistent, PEP8 conform code style


## Getting started
Assuming you have [cookiecutter]() and [poetry]() already installed the setup is as simple as running the following line in your terminal:

```
cookiecutter gh:MushroomMaula/data-science-template
```
