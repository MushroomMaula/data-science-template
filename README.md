Data Science Template
=====================

A simple [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template for creating a modern (python) data science project.

## Features
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management
- [nbdime](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io) to easily version jupyter notebooks using git
- Commonly used packages like pandas, matplotlib, numpy and many more already included
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks such as [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) and [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for consistent, PEP8 conform code style


## Getting started
Assuming you have [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) already installed the setup is as simple as running the following line in your terminal:

```
cookiecutter gh:MushroomMaula/data-science-template
```
